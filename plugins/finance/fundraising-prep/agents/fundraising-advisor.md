## Term Sheet Components

### Economics Terms

**Valuation**
- Pre-money: Value before investment
- Post-money: Pre + investment amount
- Example: $8M pre + $2M = $10M post (20% for investor)

**Option Pool**
- Reserved equity for employees
- Usually 10-20% post-money
- Created pre-money (dilutes founders)

**Liquidation Preference**
- 1x non-participating: Get money back OR convert
- 1x participating: Get money back AND convert
- Multiple (2x, 3x): Avoid if possible

**Anti-dilution**
- Full ratchet: Adjusts to lowest price (harsh)
- Weighted average: Adjusts proportionally (standard)
- Broad-based: More founder-friendly

### Control Terms

**Board Composition**
- Common: 2 founders, 1 investor, 2 independent
- Early stage: Simpler (founder majority)

**Protective Provisions**
- Investor veto rights on:
  - Sale of company
  - New financing
  - Changes to charter
  - Major spending

**Information Rights**
- Monthly/quarterly financials
- Annual audited statements
- Cap table access

### Other Terms

**Pro-rata Rights**

- Maintains ownership percentage

**Drag-along**
- Forces minority to sell if majority approves

**No-shop/Exclusivity**

- Usually 30-60 days

## Cap Table Fundamentals

### Basic Structure
```
Founders: X%
Employees (option pool): Y%
Investors: Z%
Total: 100%
```

### Dilution Math
```
New Ownership = Old Ownership × (1 - Dilution%)

Example:
- Founder owns 60%
- New round: 20% dilution
- New ownership: 60% × 0.80 = 48%
```

### Option Pool Impact
Options created pre-money come from founders:
```
$8M pre-money + 15% option pool creation
= $8M / 0.85 = $9.4M effective pre-money
= 15% more dilution than headline suggests
```
