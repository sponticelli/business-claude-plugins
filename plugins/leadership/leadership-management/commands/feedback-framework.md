# Feedback Framework

Create structured, actionable feedback for any situation using proven feedback frameworks.

## Usage

```
/feedback-framework [situation requiring feedback]
```

Provide details about:
1. What happened that requires feedback?
2. Who is receiving the feedback?
3. What is your relationship (manager, peer, report)?
4. What outcome do you want?
5. What have you observed specifically?

## Process

1. **Clarify the Situation**
   - What specifically happened?
   - What was the impact?
   - What behavior needs to change (or continue)?

2. **Choose the Framework**
   - SBI-I for behavioral feedback
   - Radical Candor for ongoing feedback
   - Feedforward for development

3. **Structure the Feedback**
   - Prepare key points
   - Anticipate reactions
   - Plan the conversation

4. **Plan Follow-up**
   - Agreement on next steps
   - Check-in timing
   - Support needed

## Output Format

## Feedback Using SBI-I Framework

### S - Situation
*When and where did this happen? Be specific.*

"[During the client meeting on Tuesday / In yesterday's code review / Over the past month...]"

### B - Behavior
*What specific, observable behavior did you notice? Facts, not interpretations.*

"[I noticed that you... / You said... / I observed that...]"

**Avoid**: Judgments, assumptions about intent, generalizations
**Include**: Specific actions, words used, patterns with examples

### I - Impact
*What was the result of that behavior?*

"[The impact was... / As a result... / This led to...]"

| Impact on... | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Project/Work | [Specific impact] |
| Team | [Specific impact] |
| You | [Specific impact] |

### I - Intent/Improvement
*What do you want them to do differently? (for redirecting) What do you want them to keep doing? (for reinforcing)*

"[Going forward, I'd like you to... / I'd like to see... / What I need is...]"

---

## The Conversation Script

### Opening
*Set context and psychological safety*

> "[Name], I wanted to share some feedback with you about [topic]. I'm sharing this because I care about your success and want to see you [achieve goal]. Is now a good time?"

### Deliver the Feedback

> **Situation**: "In [specific situation]..."
>
> **Behavior**: "I observed that you [specific behavior]..."
>
> **Impact**: "The impact of this was [specific impact]..."
>
> **Intent**: "[For redirecting]: Going forward, I'd like to see you [specific change]. [For reinforcing]: I want you to know this is exactly the kind of [quality] we value."

### Pause and Listen
*Allow them to respond. Key questions:*

- "What's your perspective on this?"
- "Help me understand what was going on for you."
- "What am I missing?"

### Reach Agreement
*Align on next steps:*

- "What do you think you could do differently next time?"
- "What support would be helpful?"
- "How can I help you with this?"

### Close Positively

> "I appreciate you being open to this feedback. I believe in your ability to [grow in this area / continue this excellent work]. Let's check in on this [timeframe]."

---

## Anticipating Reactions

### If They Get Defensive
| They might say... | You could respond... |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "That's not what happened" | "Help me understand your perspective. What did you experience?" |
| "I had no choice" | "I understand there were constraints. Let's talk about what options you might have next time." |
| "Other people do this too" | "I'm focused on your development right now. Let's talk about what you can control." |

### If They Get Emotional
| They might... | You could... |
|--------------|-------------|
| Become upset | "I can see this is difficult to hear. Would you like a moment?" |
| Shut down | "I want to make sure we're on the same page. What's going through your mind?" |
| Become angry | "I can see you're frustrated. My intent is to help you succeed." |

### If They Disagree
- Acknowledge their perspective
- Focus on impact, not intent
- Ask what they would do differently with hindsight
- Agree to observe together going forward

## Alternative Frameworks

### Radical Candor (Care Personally + Challenge Directly)
```
                    Challenge Directly
                           │
                           │
    Ruinous                │              Radical
    Empathy                │              Candor
    (Care but don't        │     (Care AND challenge)
     challenge)            │              ★
                           │
    ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────
                           │           Care Personally
    Manipulative           │              Obnoxious
    Insincerity            │              Aggression
    (Neither care          │     (Challenge but
     nor challenge)        │      don't care)
                           │
```

**Your feedback should be in the Radical Candor quadrant.**

### Feedforward (Marshall Goldsmith)
*For developmental feedback:*
1. Ask: "Can I give you a suggestion for the future?"
2. Give ONE suggestion (not criticism of past)
3. They respond with "thank you" (no defense needed)

### The COIN Model
- **C**ontext: Set the stage
- **O**bservation: What you saw/heard
- **I**mpact: The effect it had
- **N**ext: What should happen going forward

## Follow-Up Plan

### Immediate (within 24 hours)
- [ ] Send brief recap if appropriate
- [ ] Thank them for being open to feedback

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Check in: "How is [the thing we discussed] going?"

### Ongoing
- [ ] Include in regular 1:1 discussions
- [ ] Acknowledge improvement when seen
- [ ] Adjust support as needed

## Pre-Conversation Checklist

## What NOT to Do

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Feedback sandwich (good-bad-good) | Be direct but kind |
| "You always..." / "You never..." | Use specific examples |
| Feedback in public | Keep it private |
| Waiting too long | Give feedback promptly |
| Making it about personality | Focus on behavior |
| Assuming intent | Ask about their perspective |
| Unloading multiple issues | Focus on one thing |
| No follow-up | Check in on progress |
```

## Example

**Input**: `/feedback-framework My direct report has been consistently late to meetings and it's affecting the team`

**Output**: Complete feedback preparation with:
- SBI-I structured feedback for the lateness pattern
- Specific conversation script with opening, delivery, and close
- Anticipated defensive reactions and responses
- Follow-up plan including check-in timing
- Pre-conversation checklist

Apply immediately to user's input. Ask clarifying questions about specific behaviors, relationship context, or desired outcomes if needed.
