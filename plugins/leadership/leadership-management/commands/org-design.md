# Org Design

Design effective organizational structures with clear roles, reporting relationships, and team topologies.

## Usage

```
/org-design [organization context and goals]
```

Provide details about:
1. What is the current organization size/structure?
2. What problems are you trying to solve?
3. What is the growth trajectory?
4. What functions need to be covered?
5. Any constraints (budget, talent availability)?

## Process

1. **Assess Current State**
   - Current structure
   - Pain points
   - Capability gaps
   - Growth constraints

2. **Define Design Principles**
   - Strategic priorities
   - Autonomy vs. control balance
   - Specialization vs. generalization
   - Coordination mechanisms

3. **Design Structure**
   - Team topology
   - Reporting relationships
   - Role definitions
   - Spans of control

4. **Plan Transition**
   - Change management
   - Communication
   - Timeline

## Output Format

```markdown
# Organizational Design: [Organization/Team Name]

## Executive Summary
**Current State**: [Brief description of current structure]
**Key Challenge**: [Primary problem to solve]
**Recommended Structure**: [Brief description]
**Key Changes**: [Major changes]

- Recommended pod structure (3-4 pods of 8-12 engineers)
- Pod lead and engineering manager role definitions
- Tech lead vs. EM responsibilities matrix
- 6-month hiring and restructuring roadmap
