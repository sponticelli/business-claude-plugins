**After**: Desired ideal state
**Bridge**: Your product/solution

Best for: Transformation-focused products

## Persuasion Principles

### Cialdini's 6 Principles

**1. Reciprocity**
Give value first → Reader feels obligated to return favor
→ Free resources, helpful content, trials

**2. Commitment & Consistency**
Small yes → Big yes
→ Micro-conversions, progressive commitment

**3. Social Proof**
Others doing it → Must be good
→ Testimonials, logos, numbers, reviews

**4. Authority**
Experts endorse → Credibility transfer
→ Credentials, press mentions, certifications

**5. Liking**
I like you → I trust you
→ Relatable voice, shared values, authenticity

**6. Scarcity**
Limited availability → Increased desire
→ Deadlines, limited spots, exclusive access

### Loss Aversion
People fear losing more than they desire gaining.
→ Frame benefits as avoiding loss, not just gaining benefit

### Specificity
Specific claims are more believable.
→ "347% ROI" beats "significant ROI"

## Landing Page Anatomy

### Above the Fold
1. **Logo** - Brand recognition
2. **Navigation** - Minimal or none
3. **Headline** - Primary value proposition
4. **Subheadline** - Supporting benefit
5. **Hero Image/Video** - Visual reinforcement
6. **Primary CTA** - Clear action button
7. **Social Proof Snippet** - Quick credibility

### Below the Fold
1. **Problem Section** - Agitate pain points
2. **Solution Section** - How you solve it
3. **Benefits** - What they get (not features)
4. **Social Proof** - Detailed testimonials, case studies
5. **How It Works** - Simple process steps
6. **FAQ** - Handle objections
7. **Final CTA** - Repeat the ask

## Headline Formulas

### Benefit Headlines
- "Get [Desired Result] Without [Pain Point]"
- "The [Adjective] Way to [Achieve Goal]"
- "[Number] Ways to [Achieve Desired Outcome]"

### Curiosity Headlines
- "The Secret to [Desired Result] That [Authority] Don't Want You to Know"

- "What [Success Stories] Know About [Topic] That You Don't"

### Proof Headlines
- "How [Customer] Achieved [Result] in [Time]"

- "Rated #1 for [Benefit] by [Authority]"

### Question Headlines
- "Are You Making These [Number] [Topic] Mistakes?"
- "What Would You Do With [Specific Benefit]?"
- "Ready to [Achieve Goal] in [Time]?"

## CTA Best Practices

### Button Copy
**Weak**: Submit, Click Here, Learn More
**Strong**: Start My Free Trial, Get My Report, Claim My Spot

### CTA Formula
Action Verb + Your + Value
- "Get Your Free Template"
- "Start Your Free Trial"
- "Claim Your Discount"

### Supporting Copy
- Reduce friction: "No credit card required"
- Add urgency: "Limited spots available"
- Remove risk: "30-day money-back guarantee"

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Conversational Copy
- Write like you talk
- Use "you" and "your" frequently
- Contractions are your friend
- Short sentences. Even fragments.

### Power Words
**Urgency**: Now, Today, Limited, Last chance, Deadline
**Exclusivity**: Secret, Insider, Members-only, Exclusive
**Value**: Free, Save, Bonus, Extra, Premium
**Safety**: Guaranteed, Proven, Certified, Risk-free
**Curiosity**: Discover, Reveal, Unlock, Hidden

### Words to Avoid
- "We" (make it about them)
- "Things" (be specific)
- "Very/Really" (use stronger words)
- "Click here" (describe the value)
- "Submit" (use action verbs)
